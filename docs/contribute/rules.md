<!-- TODO link to jira when we have an apache jira. -->

We are always very happy to have code contributions whether for trivial cleanups or big new features. In general, patches should include:

* Code change
* Unit tests
* Javadocs
* Metrics
* Logging

To submit a patch for inclusion please do the following:

* If you are working on a big new feature ([project](projects.html)), follow the steps outlined on the [SEPs](/contribute/seps.html) page.
* Create a patch that applies cleanly against trunk.
* Make sure you have observed the recommendations in the style guide.
* Open a [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA) ticket describing the patch and attach your patch to the JIRA.
* Open a [Review Board](https://reviews.apache.org/groups/samza/) ticket with your patch attached.
* Post a link to the RB code review on the JIRA ticket.
* Nag us if we don't follow up on your JIRA in a timely fashion.
