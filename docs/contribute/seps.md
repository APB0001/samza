title: Samza Enhancement Proposals
---

<!-- TODO link to jira when we have an apache jira. -->

When making larger changes to Samza, or working on a [project](/contribute/projects.html), please write a Samza Enhancement Proposal (SEP) on the Samza wiki. The goal of the SEP is to:

1. Define the problem you're trying to solve
2. Propose a solution, and explore alternatives.
3. Instigate discussion on the issue.
4. Archive design documents for future use.

### How to Write a SEP

SEPs are stored on the Samza wiki. To write a SEP, create a new sub page on the wiki with a title formatted as SEP-# (e.g. SEP-24).

There is no set single format for a SEP, but it's common to include:

1. Table of Contents
2. Introduction
3. Definition of problem
4. Possible solutions
5. Opinion on best solution
6. Proposed metrics to add.
7. A link to the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA).
